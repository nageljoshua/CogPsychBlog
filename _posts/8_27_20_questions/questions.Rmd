# Questions

## R Questions
My questions are as follows: 
1. In Rstudio, if I want to make a new post, do I have to "copy" an old post folder or can I make a new folder and a new .Rmd file? How do I do that? Also, what is .Rmd? 
2. Do I need to keep all the meta-data about authorship and affiliation or can I delete it from some posts?
3. What is distill?
4. Are file names caps sensitive?
5. My "viewer" view doesn't work. When I "knit" a new window will pop up, but nothing shows in Viewer.

## Github Questions
1. What is the whole thing with "commit" on Github?
